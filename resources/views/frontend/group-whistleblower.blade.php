                        <p>Globose Technology Solutions Private Limited (GTSPL) is committed to conducting its business
                            legally and ethically. We encourage individuals who are concerned about improper conduct to
                            report such conduct. This policy outlines how you can do that and what we will do when we
                            receive such reports.</p>
                        <p>This policy applies globally to all GTSPL's subsidiaries, businesses, divisions, and offices.
                            It also applies across all jurisdictions where we operate. If local legislation, regulation,
                            or laws provide a higher level of protection than what is included in this policy, the local
                            legislation will take precedence.</p>
